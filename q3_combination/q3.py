# Challenge #3 - Programming
# You are given a string composed of only 1s, 0s, and Xs.
#
# Write a program that will print out every possible combination where you replace the X with both 0 and 1.
#
# Some examples:
#
# $ myprogram X0
# 00
# 10
#
# $ myprogram 10X10X0
# 1001000
# 1001010
# 1011000
# 1011010
#
# While your program will take longer to run based on the number of combinations you output, your program shouldnâ€™t crash (or hang) on an input with many Xs.
#
# What is the big O notation for this program?
